# MusicArchives

This web application is a project for a course I took in the University of Queensland. 
It is a Music Archives that allows administrators to add musicians, albums and other information to a database.
Visitors are able to view the information and look up details of interest. In addition, there is a small message board that
allows registered users to start topic threads and post replies to other user's threads.

Technology:
HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript/JQuery, DataTables, D3.js, PHP, MySQL Database.
